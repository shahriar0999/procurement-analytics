# Real-World Make-vs-Buy Decision Cases

## Understanding the Cost Equations First

### **Cost Structure Breakdown:**

**C_buy = c^buy_f + x · c^buy_v** (Equation 4.1)
- **c^buy_f**: One-time costs to set up buying (supplier search, contracts, quality audits)
- **c^buy_v**: Per-unit costs when buying (supplier price + transaction costs per unit)

**C_make = c^make_f + x · c^make_v** (Equation 4.2)  
- **c^make_f**: One-time costs to set up making (equipment, training, facility setup)
- **c^make_v**: Per-unit costs when making (materials + labor + overhead per unit)
